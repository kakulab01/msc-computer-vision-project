# Project Proposal: Multi-Class Image Classification Using Feature Extraction and Machine Learning

## 1. Title  
**Comparative Analysis of Feature Extraction Techniques and Machine Learning Classifiers for Multi-Class Image Classification**

## 2. Introduction  
Image classification is a fundamental task in computer vision with applications in object recognition, medical imaging, and autonomous systems. While deep learning (e.g., CNNs) has dominated recent research, traditional machine learning methods with handcrafted features remain relevant for interpretability and computational efficiency.

This project explores the effectiveness of different feature extraction techniques—**3D color histograms, HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients), and SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform)**—combined with classical classifiers (**Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines**) for classifying images across **20 distinct classes**.

## 3. Motivation
The exponential growth of digital image data across domains, ranging from healthcare and security to agriculture and e-commerce, necessitates accurate and efficient image classification techniques. While deep learning methods such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) dominate the field, they often require large datasets and substantial computational resources. In contrast, combining classical feature extraction techniques with machine learning algorithms offers a more interpretable, resource-efficient alternative that remains viable for many real-world applications, especially where data and computation are limited. This research explores how traditional machine learning can still be harnessed effectively for multi-class image classification by leveraging engineered features.

## 4. Solutions
This project proposes a systematic pipeline for multi-class image classification using a hybrid approach that includes:
1. Feature extraction using classical image descriptors (e.g., Histogram of Oriented Gradients, Local Binary Patterns, Color Histograms).
2. Dimensionality reduction and normalization to enhance performance and reduce overfitting.
3. Model training using established machine learning algorithms such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forests, and k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN).
4. Evaluation based on accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and computational efficiency.

## 3. Objectives  
1. Perform **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to understand dataset characteristics  
2. Extract and analyze **handcrafted features** (color, texture, shape) for discriminative power  
3. Train and optimize **multiple classifiers** using **five-fold cross-validation** and **randomized grid search**  
4. Evaluate model performance and determine the **best feature-classifier combinations**  
5. Compare results against **baseline CNN performance** (if time permits)  

## 4. Methodology  

### 4.1 Dataset & Preprocessing  
- Use a publicly available dataset (e.g., **Caltech-101, CIFAR-100 subset, or custom dataset**)  
- Perform **train-test split (80-20)** and apply **normalization/scaling**  

### 4.2 Feature Extraction  
- **3D Color Histograms**: Capture RGB/HSV distributions (8×8×8 bins)  
- **HOG**: Extract edge orientations (parameters: 9 orientations, 8×8 cells)  
- **SIFT**: Detect keypoints and encode descriptors (clustered via Bag-of-Words)  

### 4.3 Classifiers & Optimization  
- **Logistic Regression** (One-vs-Rest)  
- **K-Nearest Neighbors** (Euclidean distance, optimal *k*)  
- **Decision Trees & Random Forest** (Feature importance analysis)  
- **Support Vector Machines** (RBF/linear kernel, tuned C & γ)  
- **Hyperparameter tuning** via **randomized grid search** with **5-fold CV**  

### 4.4 Evaluation Metrics  
- **Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score**  
- **Confusion Matrix** (identify misclassified pairs)  
- **t-SNE/PCA** for feature space visualization  

## 5. Expected Outcomes  
1. Identification of the **most discriminative features** for different classes  
2. Optimal **feature-classifier pairings** (e.g., HOG + SVM for texture-rich images)  
3. Performance benchmarks for traditional ML vs. CNNs (if included)  
4. Insights into **computational trade-offs** (speed vs. accuracy)  

## 6. Tools & Technologies  
- **Python** (OpenCV, scikit-learn, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)  
- **Feature Extraction**: OpenCV (HOG, SIFT), scikit-image (Color Histograms)  
- **Machine Learning**: scikit-learn (Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest)  
- **Visualization**: t-SNE, PCA, Confusion Matrix plots
